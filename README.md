## Building and Deploying

The docs are built with [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/index.html) and deployed with GitHub Actions to the [docs.Spyder-IDE.org](https://docs.spyder-ide.org/) domain.
The ``master`` branch contains the in-development docs for Spyder 4, while the ``3.x`` branch has the docs for the previous major version, Spyder 3.
