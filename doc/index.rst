Spyder is a powerful scientific environment written in Python, for Python, and designed by and for scientists, engineers and data analysts.
It features a unique combination of the advanced editing, analysis, debugging, and profiling functionality of a comprehensive development tool with the data exploration, interactive execution, deep inspection, and beautiful visualization capabilities of a scientific package.
