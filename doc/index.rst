Spyder - Documentation
======================

Spyder is the Scientific Python Development Environment:

* A powerful interactive development environment for the Python language with
  advanced editing, interactive testing, debugging and introspection features
* A numerical computing environment thanks to the support of `IPython`
  (an enhanced interactive Python interpreter) and popular Python libraries
  such as `NumPy` (linear algebra), `SciPy` (signal and image processing)
  and `matplotlib` (interactive 2D/3D plotting).

Spyder may also be used as a library providing powerful console-related widgets
for your PyQt-based applications -- for example, it may be used to integrate a
debugging console directly in the layout of your graphical user interface.
