Static code analysis
====================

The static code analysis tool may be used directly from the :doc:`editor`, or
by entering manually the Python module or package path - i.e. it works either
with `.py` (or `.pyw`) Python scripts or with whole Python packages
(directories containing an `__init__.py` script).
