You can also modify the value of these variables directly from this pane by double clicking them under the Value column. The Plots pane will show you the figures you generate with Matplotlib and other libraries, and the Files pane allows you to browse the files on your computer and open them in the Editor with just a click."

First, let's take a look at the Editor, which you can use to open, edit and run files from your computer. I will open a short \"Hello World\" program for this demo, which you can `download here`_. Once you have it open in your Editor, you can execute it by pressing the green run button. We can see the output in the Python Console [Show IPython console] as well as the path of the file that we are running and the working directory where this code was run."

msgstr ""

#: ../../videos/first-steps-with-spyder.rst:90
msgid "Now, let's start defining some variables. We can do this both from the editor or from the Console. If I define a variable ``a = 10`` and then run this code, I can see its value in the console just by typing its name ``a``. However, you can also assign any variable in the IPython console (``b = 20``) and its value will be stored too. In both cases, they can also be seen in the Variable Explorer pane, which shows the name, type, size and value of each of the objects previously defined. In this case, we see variables ``a`` and ``b``, both of type int and with size 1. We can also define a list ``l`` with ``l = [1, 2, 3]`` and see that the type of the variable is list and the size is 3."
msgstr ""

#: ../../videos/first-steps-with-spyder.rst:92
msgid "We can change the values of the variables in the Variable Explorer too by double-clicking them and typing their new value. Now, we can check their new value in the console. In the case of a more complex type like a list, double-clicking it will open a viewer in which you can modify each of its values separately, along with other more complex operations which we'll demonstrate in a future video. We can remove a variable by right-clicking it and selecting the option Remove. After doing this, we can check in the IPython Console that the variable was actually deleted."

First, we can press :kbd:`Ctrl-I` (or :kbd:`Cmd-I` on macOS) right after the name of an object written in the Editor or the Console, for example ``numpy.array``. You can see that we obtain its documentation in the Help pane if it is available. Second, if we change the Source dropdown option to Console, we can type its name in the object box in the Help pane. Now we can get help for Numpy arrays."

You can also undock a pane, which will open a new window with it. You can have as many separate windows as you have panes, if you choose. This feature is very useful if you work with several monitors because you can undock the Editor and move it to a different monitor, while working with the rest of the panes in your main monitor."

#: ../../videos/working-with-spyder.rst:35
msgid "Let's start with the Plots pane, which is open by default when launching Spyder. To see how it works, let's open a file that will generate a couple plots from Matplotlib's documentation. You can view the generated plots in the Plots pane and browse between them using the arrows, or simply clicking them in the sidebar."

Note that every time that the code is run, new copies of the plots are generated in the pane, but you can remove any you don't want to keep around with the X button in the pane toolbar. Additionally, the pane automatically updates to show the plots generated by each console as you switch between them."

#: ../../videos/working-with-spyder.rst:39
msgid "To use a plot in another document, click the Copy to Clipboard button and paste it wherever you want, such as a word processor. Additionally, you can save a plot as a PNG by clicking the save icon."
msgstr ""

#: ../../videos/working-with-spyder.rst:41
msgid "The Files pane, also open by default, lets you browse the contents of the directories on your computer, open them in the Editor, and perform a variety of other file operations. You can show or hide the size, kind and date of the files in the pane's options menu. As you change the top-level folder you're viewing in the pane, Spyder's working directory shown in the top right of the main toolbar will update, which will also be synchronized with the currently active console. Double-clicking a text file will open it in the Editor, and copying one or more files will allow you to paste them as automatically-formatted absolute or relative paths. Right-clicking any item will offer an array of additional options for interacting with it."
msgstr ""

#: ../../videos/working-with-spyder.rst:43
msgid "You can also open a file in the system default external application, or set up a custom file association in the File Associations tab of the Files preferences pane. For example, we can add the ``.csv`` extension and associate it with LibreOffice Calc under associated applications. Now every time you click a file with this extension, it opens externally with this program."
msgstr ""

#: ../../videos/working-with-spyder.rst:45
msgid "Now, let's see how to use the Outline pane to navigate within a file. First, we have to open the pane under Panes in the View menu, since it isn't visible by default. As you can see, it shows you all the classes, methods and functions that are currently defined, and allows you to move between them with just a click. For a very large file like this one, it is very useful to switch between classes easily instead of scrolling through the four-thousand-plus lines of code. You can also browse the methods of a class by expanding it using the arrows, or the buttons in the Outline pane's toolbar. The Outline continuously updates to highlight the function, method or class corresponding to the cursor position in your code, so you can easily keep track of what object you are working on. Finally, by going to the pane options menu and activating Show all files, you can easily switch between the scripts and modules you have open, which is particularly important for navigating larger projects."
msgstr ""

#: ../../videos/working-with-spyder.rst:47
msgid "The Files pane is another useful tool for particularly larger projects. Like the Outline pane, it can be opened under Panes in the View menu. This allows you to view and navigate through all occurrences of text or regular expressions in any file in the working directory, project or another custom directory. We see, for example, in the ``mainwindow.py`` file we import the ``is_dark_font_color`` function. If we want to quickly find the file where it was defined, we can write this string in the search bar. With this search, we get 7 matches from 3 different files. When we click on any of these matches, the file is opened automatically in the Editor, right where this string appears."
msgstr ""

#: ../../videos/working-with-spyder.rst:49
msgid "Finally, we'll learn how to browse documentation using the Online Help pane. Once you open it, again under Panes in the View menu, you will see an index of modules from which documentation is available, including both those in the Python standard library and any third-party packages that may be installed in Spyder's environment. For example, we can find help for Numpy, Pandas and Matplotlib, which are all installed if you've downloaded Spyder with Anaconda. You can browse the contents in the built-in web browser provided by the pane, and click the hyperlinks within to navigate to different pages. You can also enter the name of the item you'd like documentation on in the Get field or in the space over the pane's toolbar, to load its information directly. If you're not sure of the object's name, use the Search field to view a list of results applicable to any keyword."

msgid "We can reduce the time this function takes and compare it with the one before. For this, first we have to save the data as a ``.Result`` file with the save button in the pane. Now we have to figure out how to optimize the function, so let's search for it. We see that we can speed up this function by `manually specifying a datetime format`_. So, we add the appropriate argument, ``format=\"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S.%f %z\"``, to our function call."

msgid "Now, we run the profiling again to see how our script's performance has improved. If we want to see how much we lowered the time, we can load our previous result and take a look at the diff columns. Notice the difference is green because the time was reduced by three times, taking only 13 seconds instead of 39. Our code is now 26 seconds faster!"
