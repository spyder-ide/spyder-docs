Editor
======

Spyder's text editor is a multi-language editor with features such as syntax
coloring, code analysis (real-time code analysis powered by `pyflakes` and
advanced code analysis using `pylint`), introspection capabilities such as
code completion, calltips and go-to-definition features (powered by `rope`),
function/class browser, horizontal/vertical splitting features, etc.

How to define a code cell
--------------------------

A "code cell" is a concept similar to MATLAB's "cell" (except that there is
no "cell mode" in Spyder), i.e. a block of lines to be executed at once in the
current interpreter (Python or IPython). Every script may be divided in as
many cells as needed.

Cells are separated by lines starting with:

* `#%%` (standard cell separator)
* `# %%` (standard cell separator, when file has been edited with Eclipse)
* `# <codecell>` (IPython notebook cell separator)
