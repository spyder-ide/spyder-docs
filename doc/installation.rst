Spyder is relatively easy to install on Windows, Linux and macOS.
Just make sure to read and follow these instructions with care.

If you run into problems, before posting a report, *please* consult our comprehensive :doc:`troubleshooting guide</troubleshooting/first-steps>` and search the `issue tracker`_ for your error message and problem description.
These methods generally fix or isolate the great majority of install-related difficulties.
Thanks!

   Spyder now offers :ref:`standalone installers<standalone_installers_ref>` for Windows and macOS, making it easier to get up and running with the application without having to download Anaconda or manually install it in your existing environment.
   While we still support Anaconda, we recommend this install method on those platforms to avoid most problems with package conflicts and other issues.

=====================
Standalone installers
=====================

Our standalone installers for Windows and macOS are available from Spyder 4.2 onwards.
We recommend using this installation method on those platforms, but we offer several other options for Linux, advanced users and specific needs, so keep reading if that's the case for you.


Downloading and installing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To download the supported Spyder installer for your platform, simply click the appropriate link below.
(For Linux, see the :ref:`anaconda_install_ref` section).
Then, double-click the downloaded file to open the installer.
If a security warning pops up, you may need to click :guilabel:`Yes`, :guilabel:`OK`, :guilabel:`Open`, :guilabel:`Allow` or similar.

On Windows, if a SmartScreen dialog appears, click :guilabel:`More info` followed by :guilabel:`Run anyway`, and then proceed through the steps in the installer.

On macOS, open the disk image and drag Spyder to your :guilabel:`Applications` folder.

.. note::

   "Lite" versions of both installers are also available from the `releases page`_, which are somewhat smaller than the full installers.
   These lack a number of optional but recommended dependencies, such as NumPy, SciPy and Pandas, meaning that a few :doc:`/panes/variableexplorer` features, including graphical data import wizards and support for rich display and editing of NumPy arrays and Pandas DataFrames, will not be available.
   Given this only saves a modest amount of space while missing out on significant features, we recommend using the full installers unless minimizing download/install size and memory usage is a priority.

.. _releases page: https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/releases/latest


Running from a standalone install
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To run Spyder when installed standalone, you can simply use your operating system's typical method of launching applications, such as opening it from the Start menu on Windows (or the Taskbar, if you've pinned it there), or from Launchpad, Spotlight or the Applications folder on macOS (or the Dock, if you've added it there).

On macOS, the first time you open Spyder, you may see a message that it cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified.
If so, right-click on the application, select :guilabel:`Open`, then click :guilabel:`Open` in the resulting dialog, and the warning will no longer be shown.
You can also click :guilabel:`Open Anyway` under :menuselection:`Security & Privacy --> General` in System Preferences.

For more information on installing your own packages and using standalone Spyder with your existing Python environments, see our :ref:`FAQ<using_spyder_faqs_ref>`.



.. _anaconda_install_ref:

========
Anaconda
========

Spyder is included by default in the `Anaconda Python distribution`_, which comes with everything you need to get started in an all-in-one package, and is our recommended installation method on Linux (and supported on the other platforms too).

.. _Anaconda Python distribution: https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual


Running with Anaconda
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To run Spyder after installing it with Anaconda, the recommended method on Windows is to launch it via the Start menu shortcut.
On other platforms, open Anaconda Navigator, scroll to Spyder under ``Home``, and click ``Launch``.

.. image:: /images/installation/installation-anaconda-navigator.png
   :alt: Anaconda Navigator showing Spyder

If Spyder does not launch via this method or you prefer to use the command line, open Anaconda Prompt (Windows) or your terminal (other platforms), type ``conda activate base`` then ``spyder``.


New Conda environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you would like to have Spyder in a dedicated environment to update it separately from your other packages and avoid any conflicts, you can.
Just run the following command in your Anaconda Prompt (Windows) or terminal (other platforms), for a minimal install of Spyder into a new environment called ``spyder-env``:

.. code-block:: bash

   conda create -n spyder-env spyder=4

To install Spyder's optional dependencies as well for full functionality, use the following command instead:

.. code-block:: bash

   conda create -n spyder-env spyder=4 numpy scipy pandas matplotlib sympy cython

To install Spyder from Conda-Forge instead of the default Anaconda channel, add ``-c conda-forge`` at the end of either of the previous commands.

You can then run Spyder by the same methods as above, except make sure to select the start menu shortcut with ``(spyder-env)`` in the name, select the ``spyder-env`` environment on the left before launching it with Navigator, or type ``conda activate spyder-env`` before launching it on the command line.

For more information on this approach, and using Spyder with your existing Python environments and packages, please see our `Guide to working with packages and environments in Spyder`_.

.. _Guide to working with packages and environments in Spyder: https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/wiki/Working-with-packages-and-environments-in-Spyder



===================
Alternative methods
===================

.. caution::

   While we offer alternative Spyder installation options for users who desire them, we currently lack the resources to offer individual assistance for problems specific to installing via these alternative distributions.
   Therefore, we recommend you switch to our :ref:`standalone installers<standalone_installers_ref>` (Windows and macOS) or :ref:`anaconda_install_ref` if you encounter installation issues you are unable to solve on your own.


Windows
~~~~~~~

Spyder is included in the `WinPython`_ scientific Python distribution (although Anaconda's ``conda`` package and environment manager is not).
You can use Spyder immediately after installing, just like with Anaconda.

.. _WinPython: https://winpython.github.io/


macOS
~~~~~

Thanks to the `MacPorts project`_, Spyder can be installed using its ``port`` package manager; however, the included Spyder version may be out of date or have MacPorts-specific issues outside of Spyder's control.

.. _MacPorts project: https://www.macports.org/

There are `several versions`_ available from which you can choose.

.. _several versions: https://ports.macports.org/?search=spyder&search_by=name


Linux
~~~~~

.. warning::

   Distribution packages are created by third parties, are often outdated relative to the current Spyder release, and may contain bugs and be missing features relative to the current supported version.
   As such, given we are not able to provide official support for them, we strongly recommend using :ref:`anaconda_install_ref` on Linux whenever practical (or :ref:`pip<pip_install_spyder_ref>`, for advanced users).

Spyder can be installed via third-party distro packages on most common Linux distributions.

Running Spyder installed this way will generally be the same as any other distro-installed application.
Alternatively, it can be launched from the terminal with ``spyder`` (or ``spyder3``, on older versions of some distros).


Ubuntu
------

Using the package manager:

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo apt install spyder

Spyder's Ubuntu package is available on the `Ubuntu package repository`_.

.. _Ubuntu package repository: https://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=spyder


Debian
------

Using the package manager:

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo apt install spyder

Spyder's Debian package is available on the `Debian package repository`_.

.. _Debian package repository: https://packages.debian.org/stable/spyder


Other distributions
-------------------

Spyder is also available in other GNU/Linux distributions, like

* `Arch Linux`_
* `Fedora`_
* `Gentoo`_
* `openSUSE`_

.. _Arch Linux: https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/spyder-git/
.. _Fedora: https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Spyder
.. _Gentoo: https://packages.gentoo.org/packages/dev-python/spyder
.. _openSUSE: https://software.opensuse.org/package/spyder

Please refer to your distribution's documentation for how to install Spyder.



.. _pip_install_spyder_ref:

=========
Using pip
=========

.. warning::

   While this installation method is a viable option for experienced users, installing Spyder (and other PyData-stack packages) with ``pip`` can lead to a number of tricky issues, particularly on Windows and macOS.
   While you are welcome to try this on your own, we unfortunately do not have the resources to help you if you do run into problems, except to recommend our :ref:`standalone installers<standalone_installers_ref>` (Windows and macOS) or :ref:`anaconda_install_ref`.

You can install Spyder with the ``pip`` package manager, which comes by default with most Python installations.
Before installing Spyder itself by this method, you need to acquire the `Python`_ programming language.

.. _Python: https://www.python.org/

.. note::

   Due to a known issue with some DEB-based Linux distributions (Debian, Ubuntu, Mint), you might also need to install the ``pyqt5-dev-tools`` package first, with ``sudo apt install pyqt5-dev-tools``.

You'll first want to create and activate a virtual environment in which to install Spyder, via one of the following methods.

With ``virtualenvwrapper``:

.. code-block:: bash

   mkvirtualenv spyder-env
   workon spyder-env

Otherwise, on macOS/Linux/Unix:

.. code-block:: bash

   python3 -m venv spyder-env
   source spyder-env/bin/activate

or on Windows:

.. code-block:: bash

   python -m venv spyder-env
   spyder-env/Scripts/activate.bat

After activating your environment, to install Spyder and its other dependencies, run ``pip install spyder``.

.. image:: /images/installation/installation-pip-install.gif
   :alt: Running Spyder installation with pip

You may need to install a Qt binding (PyQt5) separately with ``pip`` if running under Python 2.

To launch Spyder after installing, ensure your environment is activated and run the ``spyder3`` command.



===============
Updating Spyder
===============

To update Spyder installed via our :ref:`standalone packages<standalone_installers_ref>` on Windows and macOS, you'll currently need to manually download and install the latest release (if on Windows, make sure to remove the old version first from Control Panel/System Settings).

If you installed Spyder through Anaconda, WinPython, MacPorts, or your system package manager, update using those same methods.
With Anaconda, just run (in Anaconda Prompt if on Windows, otherwise in your system terminal):

.. code-block:: bash

   conda update anaconda
   conda update spyder

If you installed Spyder via the advanced/cross-platform method, ``pip``, run ``pip install --upgrade spyder``.
This command will also update all Spyder dependencies, so we recommend you use an isolated virtual environment to avoid any potential unintended effects on other installed packages.



==================
Development builds
==================

If you want to try the next Spyder version before it is released, you can!
You may want to do this for fixing bugs in Spyder, adding new features, learning how Spyder works or just getting a taste of what the IDE can do.
