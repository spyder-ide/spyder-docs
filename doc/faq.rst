.. dropdown:: Q: What are the system requirements for Spyder? How resource-intensive is it?
   :container: + dropdown-id-run-system-reqs

   Spyder works on modern versions of Windows, macOS and Linux (see the table below for recommended versions) via Anaconda, as well as other methods.
   It typically uses relatively minimal CPU when idle, and 0.5 GB - 1 GB of RAM, depending on how long you've been using it and how many files, projects, panes and consoles you have open.
   It should work on any system with a dual-core or better x64 processor and at least 4 GB of RAM, although 8 GB is *strongly* recommended for best performance when running other applications.
   However, the code you run, such as scientific computation and deep learning models, may require additional resources beyond this baseline for Spyder itself.

   .. table::

      ================   ===================
      Operating system   Version
      ================   ===================
      Windows            Windows 8.1

.. dropdown:: Q: How do I install Python packages to use within Spyder if I downloaded Spyder from the standalone installers?
   :container: + dropdown-id-using-packages-installer

   If you want to use other modules in Spyder that don't come with our installer, you need to install `Miniconda`_ (**only if you don't have Anaconda or Miniconda yet!**). For Spyder to recognize it, the installation should be done in one of the following default paths:

   .. table::

       +------------------------------------+---------------------------------+
       |Windows                             | macOS                           |

       |C:\\Anaconda3                       |   /opt/anaconda3                |
       +------------------------------------+---------------------------------+
       |C:\\Miniconda3                      |   /opt/miniconda3               |
       +------------------------------------+---------------------------------+
       |C:\\ProgramData\\Anaconda           |                                 |
       +------------------------------------+---------------------------------+
       |C:\\ProgramData\\Miniconda          |                                 |
       +------------------------------------+---------------------------------+
       |C:\\ProgramData\\Anaconda3          |                                 |
       +------------------------------------+---------------------------------+
       |C:\\ProgramData\\Miniconda3         |                                 |
       +------------------------------------+---------------------------------+

   .. _Miniconda: https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html

   Then, you need to create a new conda environment with the modules that you want to use with Spyder and include ``spyder-kernels`` in it. For example, if you want to use ``scikit-learn``, open your terminal or the Anaconda prompt on Windows and run the following commands:

   .. code-block:: bash

      conda create -n spyder-env -y
      conda activate spyder-env
      conda install spyder-kernels scikit-learn -y

   Finally, you need to connect Spyder to this environment by changing Spyder’s default Python interpreter. To do this, click the name of the current environment in the status bar, and then click :guilabel:`Change default environment in Preferences`.

   .. image:: /images/faq/faq-change-environment.png
      :alt: Change default environment in Preferences option in status bar

   This will open the :guilabel:`Preferences` dialog in the :guilabel:`Python interpreter` section. Here, select the option :guilabel:`Use the following Python interpreter`, and use the dropdown below to select your preferred environment. If it is not listed, use the text box or the :guilabel:`Select file` button to enter the path to the Python interpreter you want to use.

   .. image:: /images/faq/faq-python-interpreter-modules.png
      :alt: Preferences showing changing Python interpreter

   **Your new environment will only be listed here if you installed Miniconda (or Anaconda) in the default path as shown in the table above.**

   Click :guilabel:`Restart kernel` in the :guilabel:`Consoles` menu for this change to take effect.

Troubleshooting
===============

.. dropdown:: Q: I've found a bug or issue with Spyder. What do I do?
   :container: + dropdown-id-troubleshooting-spyder

   You should first follow the steps in our :doc:`troubleshooting guide</troubleshooting/first-steps>`.
   If you can't solve your problem, open an issue by following the instructions in our :doc:`/troubleshooting/submit-a-report` section.


.. dropdown:: Q: I get an error in the IPython console running my code! Help!
   :container: + dropdown-id-troubleshooting-running-code

   First, make sure the error you are seeing is not a bug in your code.
   To confirm this, try running it in any standard Python interpreter.
   If the error still occurs, the problem is likely with your code and a site like `Stack Overflow`_ might be the best place to start.
   Otherwise, start at the :doc:`/troubleshooting/basic-first-aid` section of our troubleshooting guide.

   .. _Stack Overflow: https://stackoverflow.com


.. dropdown:: Q: Code completion/help doesn't work; what can I do?
   :container: + dropdown-id-troubleshooting-completion

   If nothing is displayed in the calltip, hover hint or :doc:`/panes/help` pane, make sure the object you are inspecting has a docstring, and try executing your code in the :doc:`/panes/ipythonconsole` to get help and completions there.
   If this doesn't work, try restarting PyLS by right-clicking the :guilabel:`LSP Python` label item in the statusbar at the bottom of Spyder's main window, and selecting the :guilabel:`Restart Python Language Server` option.

   For more information, go to the :ref:`code-completion-problems-ref` section in the :doc:`/troubleshooting/common-illnesses` page of our troubleshooting guide.


.. dropdown:: Q: I get the message "An error occurred while starting the kernel". How do I fix this?
   :container: + dropdown-id-troubleshooting-starting-kernel

   First, make sure your version of Spyder-Kernels is compatible with that of Spyder.

    .. table::

       ==============   ==============
       Spyder           Spyder-Kernels
       ==============   ==============
       4.0.0-4.0.1      1.8.1
       4.1.0-4.1.2      1.9.0
       4.1.3            1.9.1
       4.1.4            1.9.3
       4.1.5-4.1.6      1.9.4
       4.2.0            1.10.0
       ==============   ==============

   To install the right version, type the following on the command line (or Anaconda Prompt on Windows)

   .. code-block:: bash

      conda install spyder-kernels=<VERSION>

   For more information, go to the :ref:`starting-kernel-problems-ref` section in the :doc:`/troubleshooting/common-illnesses` page of our troubleshooting guide.


.. dropdown:: Q: Spyder doesn't launch or is slow on macOS Big Sur. How can I get it working?
   :container: + dropdown-id-troubleshooting-macos-bigsur

   Spyder is in the final stages of being updated for full compatibility with macOS 11 Big Sur, which will be released by the end of 2020 as part of version 4.2.1.
   However, you can get it working right now with the workaround below.
   Make sure you have the Anaconda or Miniconda distribution installed, and run the following commands in the Terminal to install Spyder from Conda-Forge in a clean environment:

    .. code-block:: bash

       conda create -n spyder-dev python=3
       conda activate spyder-dev
       conda install -c conda-forge spyder

   Then, whenever you want to start Spyder, run the following from the Terminal:

   .. code-block:: bash

      conda activate spyder-dev
      export QT_MAC_WANTS_LAYER=1
      spyder



============
About Spyder
============

.. dropdown:: Q: What's Spyder's licensing situation? Is commercial use allowed?
   :container: + dropdown-id-commercial-use

   Spyder is 100% free and open source; there is no paid version or prohibition on commercial use.
   It is developed by its international user community, and supported by its users through `OpenCollective`_ and by its generous sponsoring organizations, including `Quansight`_ and `NumFOCUS`_.
   Our source code, standalone installers and most of our distribution methods (Pip/PyPI, Linux distros, MacPorts, WinPython, etc) can be freely redistributed, used and modified by anyone, for any purpose, including commercial use.
   For more details about the situation with Anaconda, see `that question`_.

   .. _OpenCollective: https://opencollective.com/spyder
   .. _Quansight: https://www.quansight.com/
   .. _NumFOCUS: https://numfocus.org/
   .. _that question: #anaconda-license


.. dropdown:: Q: What do the Anaconda licensing changes mean for Spyder?
   :container: + dropdown-id-anaconda-license

   If you use Spyder with the Anaconda distribution, they `recently changed`_ their `Terms of Service`_ to add restrictions on large (> 200 employee) for-profit companies using Anaconda on a large scale.
   However, these terms only apply to the package infrastructure (the full Anaconda distribution and the ``defaults`` conda channel).
   Instead, you can simply download the similar `Miniforge distribution`_, which is 100% open source and identical to full Anaconda (aside from not bundling the Python packages installed by default in the Anaconda ``base`` environment, which we recommend you avoid using anyway given any problems here can break your whole installation).
   Then, simply install the packages you need (including Spyder, if you aren't using our recommended :ref:`standalone_installers_ref`) with ``conda`` as you usually do.
   Miniforge will automatically use the community-maintained Conda-Forge repository, which has a much wider variety of packages and is generally more up to date than the Anaconda equivalent, in addition to being free of any commercial restrictions.
   For more, see our :doc:`/installation`.
